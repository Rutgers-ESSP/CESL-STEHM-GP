## Overview

This code is intended to be used to generate Gaussian process-based, spatio-temporal empirical hierarchical models of sea-level data with both vertical and temporal uncertainty. It assumes uncertainties are normally distributed, and uses the noisy-input Gaussian process method of McHutchon and Ramussen (2011) to translate temporal uncertainties into comparable vertical uncertainties.    

This code requires MATLAB with the Statistics, Optimization, and Global Optimization Toolboxes. It is known to run with MATLAB 2015b.

The MFILES directory contains the core functions of this code. The scripts-KoppEtAl2016 directory contains the scripts using these core functions to generate the analyses described in Kopp et al. (2016). The scripts-KempEtAl2018 contains the scripts associated with Kemp et al. (2018). The scripts-skeleton directory contains a template that can be used for regional applications.

The master script for these applications is runAnalyzeCESL, which calls various subsidiary scripts. Particularly attention should be paid to runSetupHoloceneCovariance, which defines the covariance functions with characterize the different priors, including the hyperparameter bounds used by the optimization code. This is the most intellectually challenging part of the exercise, as it is effectively the model specification step. Attention should also be paid to runImportCESLDataSets, which imports the data files.
